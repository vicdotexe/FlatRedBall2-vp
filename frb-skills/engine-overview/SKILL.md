# FlatRedBall2 Engine Overview

FlatRedBall2 is a 2D game engine built on MonoGame. It provides physics, collision, rendering, input, and UI (via Gum) out of the box. Game code creates Screens, Entities, and wires them together.

## What the Engine Does Automatically

- **Physics**: `pos += vel*dt + acc*(dt^2/2)`, `vel += acc*dt`, `vel -= vel*drag*dt` — every frame, for every entity
- **Collision resolution**: All registered `CollisionRelationship` pairs are tested and resolved after physics
- **Rendering**: Everything added via `screen.Add(renderable)` is drawn, sorted by Layer + Z
- **Input polling**: `Input` updates keyboard, mouse, and gamepad state each frame
- **Gum UI updates**: Click/hover/focus events routed to all active Gum elements
- **Screen transitions**: Old screen torn down, new screen initialized — entities, factories, Gum elements all cleaned up automatically
- **Camera**: Initialized from window viewport; transforms world coordinates to screen

## What Game Code Must Implement

- **Entity subclasses** — override `CustomInitialize` (add shapes, input) and `CustomActivity` (per-frame logic)
- **Screen subclasses** — override `CustomInitialize` (create factories, entities, collision relationships, UI)
- **Collision relationships** — call `AddCollisionRelationship` in screen's `CustomInitialize`
- **Game1.cs** — initialize `FlatRedBallService.Default`, call `Update`/`Draw` each frame
- **Save/load** — the engine offers nothing here; use standard .NET (`System.IO` + `System.Text.Json`, or your serializer of choice). There is no FRB2 save API to search for.

## Frame Loop Order

Each frame runs in this order:

1. **Screen transition** (if pending) — old screen destroyed, new screen initialized
2. **Input update** — keyboard, mouse, gamepad polled
3. **Gum update** — UI input events routed
4. **Physics** — entity positions updated from velocity/acceleration/drag
5. **Collision** — registered relationships resolved; positions corrected
6. **Entity `CustomActivity`** — each entity's per-frame logic
7. **Screen `CustomActivity`** — screen-level logic (sees post-collision, post-entity state)
8. **Draw** — all registered renderables drawn

## Bootstrapping a Game

`Game1.cs` wires the MonoGame loop to FRB: `PrepareWindow<TScreen>` in the constructor, then `FlatRedBallService.Default.Initialize(this)` + `Start<TScreen>()` in `Initialize`, then `Update`/`Draw` each frame. The complete template — including the `GraphicsProfile.HiDef` setup that crashes at startup if omitted — lives in `sample-project-setup`; don't hand-roll it.

## Key Design Rules

- **Y+ is up** in world space. Camera flips Y for screen rendering.
- **Always use `Factory<T>`** to create entities — never `new MyEntity()`. Factory sets `Engine`, registers with the screen, and enables `GetFactory<T>()`.
- **No static state** (engine infrastructure only) — only `FlatRedBallService.Default` is static. Everything else is accessed via `Engine` on entities or directly on screens. Game code may use static singletons for global game data (e.g., `GameData.Current` holding a monster roster or player save state) — this rule prohibits engine-layer statics, not application-layer ones.
- **Shapes default to `IsVisible = false`** — always set `IsVisible = true`.
- **`Entity.Engine`**: Use `CustomInitialize`, not the constructor — `Engine` is null until Factory injects it.
- **Use Gum for all UI** — HUD, health bars, menus, win/lose screens, any text display. Shapes are for world-space game objects (collision geometry, projectiles, platforms). If you reach for a shape to build UI, stop and use Gum instead.

## What a Screen Looks Like

A screen creates its `Factory<T>` instances in `CustomInitialize`, spawns entities with `Create()`, and wires `AddCollisionRelationship` over those factories — the gestalt the per-topic skills show piecewise:

<!-- skill-creator: allow-long-csharp reason="canonical screen gestalt — factory fields + Create + collision wiring composed in one place; the composition is the point and isn't shown together elsewhere" -->
```csharp
public class GameScreen : Screen
{
    private Factory<Player> _playerFactory = null!;
    private Factory<Wall> _wallFactory = null!;

    public override void CustomInitialize()
    {
        _playerFactory = new Factory<Player>(this);
        _wallFactory = new Factory<Wall>(this);
        _playerFactory.Create();

        AddCollisionRelationship<Player, Wall>(_playerFactory, _wallFactory)
            .MoveFirstOnCollision();
    }
}
```
