# FlatRedBall2 — Todo

**No speculative items.** Every entry must be either (a) ready to work on now or (b) ready to discuss now. "Eventually," "someday," "maybe if it comes up" do not belong here — they're noise that buries real work and never gets revisited. If an idea is interesting but not actionable, let it surface again organically when a real use case appears; don't pre-emptively log it.

Open work only. When an item ships, delete it — don't leave a "landed" breadcrumb. Design decisions and historical context that outlive a TODO belong in skill files, XML docs, or commit messages, not here.

## Entity-attached Gum visuals are not in Gum's update tree

`Entity.Add(GraphicalUiElement)` and `Entity.Add(FrameworkElement)` wrap the visual in a `GumRenderable`, register it for rendering, and drive its position from the entity's `AbsoluteX/Y` each frame — but never add it as a child of any Gum root. Consequences:

1. **Forms controls aren't live.** A `Button` added to an entity renders but doesn't receive cursor/click events, because Gum Forms input handling walks `Root.Children` (or `MainRoot`) to dispatch. The user sees a button-shaped thing that does nothing.
2. **Hot-reload skips them.** `GumHotReloadManager.PerformReload` only rebuilds `root.Children`. Entity-attached visuals are invisible to it. Today the workaround is to subscribe to `FlatRedBallService.GumHotReloadCompleted` and `RestartScreen(HotReload)`, which works but throws out everything.
3. **Animations/state interpolations on entity visuals may not tick** if Gum's per-frame update walks `Root` rather than tracking elements globally.

Possible directions:
- Add a hidden "entity-attached" Gum sub-root that the engine maintains as a child of `Root`, parented under it for update/input/hot-reload purposes but with layout that doesn't disturb world-space-driven positioning. Visuals added via `Entity.Add(...)` go in there.
- Or reach into Gum's Forms input system to register entity-attached `FrameworkElement`s as input-eligible without re-parenting.
- Either way: fixing this also fixes per-element hot-reload for entity visuals (no screen restart needed), so it's worth doing properly rather than papering over each symptom.

## Deterministic seeds for game-owned Randoms under automation mode

`FlatRedBallService.Random` is now seeded deterministically when automation activates (via `EnableAutomationMode(seed)`). What's still open: game code that constructs its own `Random` / `GameRandom` doesn't go through the engine's instance, so `new Random()` calls leak non-determinism into recorded runs. Need an API for game code to ask the engine for a seed (e.g. `FlatRedBallService.NextSeed()` derived from the engine's seeded sequence) so all gameplay randomness collapses onto one reproducible chain. Decide whether this should also retroactively cover libraries the engine consumes that allocate their own RNG internally, or whether that's strictly the game's problem.

## Web load times for large Gum projects

Initial load is slow on the BlazorGL/KNI target when a `.gumx` references many components — fonts, control templates, generated runtime types all compile/initialize on the main thread before the first frame draws. Need to (a) measure where the time actually goes (Gum project load vs. runtime registration via `RegisterRuntimeType` module initializers vs. asset decode), (b) decide whether the fix is engine-side (lazy/deferred runtime registration, parallel asset decode) or Gum-side (incremental project load), and (c) confirm WASM-specific costs separate from the same load on desktop. Solitaire's `.gumx` is the readily-available large project to profile against.

## Multiple Gum screens and transitions

Today a screen calls `this.Add(new GameScreenGum())` once in `CustomInitialize` and that visual lives until the FRB Screen tears down. There's no first-class story for (a) hosting multiple Gum screens within one FRB Screen with a current/next swap, or (b) cross-fading / sliding between them. Game code can hand-roll this with two `FrameworkElement`s and a tween on alpha/position, but the absence of an idiomatic pattern means every consumer reinvents it. Decide: is this a sample-level recipe (document the tween-between-two-roots pattern), a Gum-level Forms feature (a `ScreenHost` control), or an FRB-level helper (`Screen.PushGumScreen` / `PopGumScreen` with a built-in transition arg)?

## SVG and Lottie support in Gum

Gum currently ships with raster-only visuals (`Sprite`, `NineSlice`, `ColoredRectangle`). Vector / animated-vector formats — SVG for static UI art, Lottie for animated UI (the After Effects → Bodymovin export pipeline) — would close a real gap for UI-heavy games. Open questions: Does this belong in Gum (new runtime types alongside `Sprite`) or in FRB2 (an `IRenderable` wrapper that hosts an SVG/Lottie renderer)? Which third-party renderer? — `Svg.Skia` and `SkiaSharp.Skottie` are the obvious starting points but pull SkiaSharp into the dependency graph, which has its own desktop/WASM size implications. Confirm WASM viability before committing.

## Rive support (lower priority than Lottie)

Rive is the interactive-animation alternative to Lottie — richer state-machine model, but a heavier runtime and a paid editor. Track this only as the secondary option after Lottie lands; if Lottie covers the actual UI animation use cases the engine sees, Rive may never be worth the integration cost. Decision criteria: does any sample or downstream user actually need Rive's interactive features (state machines triggered from game code), or are pre-rendered animation clips sufficient?

## Clean up build warnings to zero

Every recent build of Solitaire reports the same three warnings, and the engine project has more under nullability / missing-XML-doc rules. Currently these are background noise — but they hide *real* warnings that get introduced, and the eventual goal (per `src/FlatRedBall2.csproj`'s comment on `GenerateDocumentationFile`: "Promote to error before the first stable (non-preview) NuGet ships") is zero warnings on a clean build.

Known categories:
- **`CS1591` — missing XML doc on public members.** Engine-side. Currently surfaces on `GumRenderable.ToString()` and likely others. Fix: write the docs (most are obvious from the member name) or, where the type is genuinely an internal-leak that shouldn't be public, narrow the visibility.
- **`CS0108` / `CS0114` — generated Gum control classes hide inherited members** (`MenuItem.MenuItemCategoryState`, `PasswordBox.Placeholder`, others). These come out of Gum's codegen; fix is upstream in Gum (emit `new` / `override` keyword) or a codegen-template tweak the consumer can apply. Track separately from engine work.
- **Nullability warnings inside `tests/`.** The two `EntityVector2TweenTests`/`EntityColorTweenTests` `CS8600`/`CS8625` patterns in test code that aren't covered by `Nullable=enable`. Easy mechanical fix.
- **Gum source warnings** (when project-referenced, not packaged). Out of scope here — they only appear during in-place Gum debugging and aren't shipped.

Do this as a sweep, not piecemeal: a single PR that drives the engine and sample warning count to zero, then promotes warnings to errors in CI so regressions are caught.

## 3D transformations on entities (and Gum visuals attached to them)

We have no story for 3D effects — card flip, page turn, screen fold-out, perspective tilt — on either sprites or entity-attached Gum hierarchies. Today an entity has `Rotation` (Z-axis only) and `Position`; nothing exposes the full 3D world matrix needed for a perspective quad.

The shape of a fix is roughly known: render the entity's 2D contents into a `RenderTarget2D`, then draw that texture as a textured quad whose four corners are computed from a 3D world matrix (translate / rotate-X / rotate-Y / perspective-project). For sprites, capturing into a render target is overkill — you can just push 3D-transformed vertices through `BasicEffect` directly. But for Gum: Gum's pipeline draws an entire hierarchy of nested visuals through `GumBatch`, and there's no clean way to intercept that as 3D vertices without going through a render target.

Open questions before designing:
1. **API surface.** Add `Entity.Rotation3D` (a `Quaternion` or Euler triple)? Or a separate `Effect` / `Pose3D` wrapper component that opts an entity in, since most entities never need it and shouldn't pay the matrix cost?
2. **Render-target lifecycle.** Per-entity `RenderTarget2D` is too expensive to allocate naively (Solitaire would want 52 of them). Pool them? Allocate only on entities that opt in? Reuse a single shared RT and draw into it once per 3D-transformed entity per frame?
3. **Cursor hit-testing through 3D.** Gum's Forms input runs in 2D canvas space. A button on a card that's tilted 30° on the X-axis still needs to be clickable. That means inverse-projecting the cursor back through the entity's 3D matrix into canvas space before dispatch. Gum's `Cursor.TransformMatrix` is a 2D affine matrix — confirm whether it handles a perspective inverse correctly, or whether the engine needs to do the un-project itself before handing coords to Gum.
4. **Z-sorting and depth.** A 3D-transformed entity has parts at different screen-Z. Does the existing 2D render-list Z sort still work, or does the depth buffer need to come on for these passes? If yes, what does that mean for the rest of the 2D pipeline that currently assumes no depth test?

This is a meaningful chunk of engine work — likely starts with the simpler sprite-only path (no render target, just 3D vertices through `BasicEffect`) to validate the API shape, then layers in the render-target path for Gum hierarchies once cursor hit-testing under 3D is settled.

## Figma → Gum import path

Designers want to author UI in Figma and have it appear in Gum without manual recreation. No existing converter — the open question is whether to (a) write a Figma plugin that emits `.gucx`/`.gusx` directly, (b) export Figma as SVG and rely on an SVG-import path in Gum (which depends on the SVG/Lottie work above), or (c) export Figma to Lottie and lean on the Lottie path. Each has tradeoffs in fidelity (what Figma features survive the round-trip), maintenance burden (the plugin path requires keeping up with Figma's API), and ordering (Lottie/SVG support unblocks paths b and c). Decide the strategy before estimating effort.
